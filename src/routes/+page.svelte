<p>
	I'm Abraham Men√©ndez, a 30-year-old Spanish software developer based in Amsterdam (Netherlands).
</p>

<p>
	If you are here, you probably already know that I love building software. These days I'm doing it
	at
	<a class="current-job" href="https://gorillas.io/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Gorillas</a
	>
	as a Checkout Tech Lead. Prior to joining them, I was a Team Lead at
	<a class="previous-job" href="https://www.sngular.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Sngular</a
	>. You can check out my full work history
	<a
		class="job-history"
		href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-menendez"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	As I strongly believe in giving back, I'm also trying to be a valuable Mentor at <a
		class="oss"
		href="https://exercism.com/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Exercism</a
	>, a not-for-profit organization that teaches programming.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not really into social media (there are too many distractions nowadays), but I do have a <a
		class="short-form-social"
		href="https://twitter.com/whoisabraham"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a
	> that I mostly use to retweet other people's thoughts. I'm exploring different platforms to share
	more in-depth thoughts, but I haven't found the right one yet.
</p>

<p>
	Although I don't have as much free time as I would like, I usually try to develop
	<a
		class="repositories"
		href="https://github.com/abrahammenendez"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">little projects</a
	>
	on my own time. Obviously, most of them end up in the graveyard of unfinished stuff. This year I think
	I will finally finish something worth talking about, so let's keep in touch, OK?
</p>

<p>
	See you around, <br />
