<p>
	I'm Abraham Menéndez, a 30-year-old Spanish software developer based in Amsterdam (Netherlands).
</p>

<p>
	If you are here, you probably already know that I love building software. These days I'm doing it
	at
	<a class="current-job" href="https://gorillas.io/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Gorillas</a
	>
	as a Checkout Tech Lead. Prior to joining them, I was a Team Lead at
	<a class="previous-job" href="https://www.sngular.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Sngular</a
	>. You can take a look at my full work history
	<a
		class="job-history"
		href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-menendez"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a
	>.
</p>

<p>
	I´m also a proud small investor in <a
		class="investment-1"
		href="https://gumroad.com/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Gumroad</a
	>, an e-commerce platform that makes it very easy for creators to get paid for their work. Check
	it out if it piques your interest!
</p>

<p>
	As I strongly believe in giving back, you can find me trying to be a valuable Mentor at <a
		class="oss"
		href="https://exercism.com/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Exercism</a
	>, a not-for-profit organization that teaches programming to anyone who wants to learn.
</p>

<p>
	Social media is not my thing (there are too many distractions nowadays), but I do have a <a
		class="short-form-social"
		href="https://twitter.com/whoisabraham"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a
	> that I mostly use to retweet other people's opinions. I'm exploring different platforms to share
	more in-depth thoughts, but I haven't found the right one yet.
</p>

<p>
	Although I don't have as much spare time as I would like, I usually try to work on
	<a
		class="repositories"
		href="https://github.com/abrahammenendez"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">small projects</a
	>
	whenever I can. Obviously, most of them end up in the graveyard of unfinished stuff. This year I plan
	to finish something worth talking about, so let's keep in touch, OK?
</p>

<p>
	See you around, <br />
