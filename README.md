## What is this?

I'm always eager to learn about FE in my spare time because I mostly do BE work at my job. I have a pretty basic [personal website](https://abrahammenendez.com/), this is just a copy made with SvelteKit. Tinkering with the framework was fun!

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deploying

```bash
npm run deploy
```
